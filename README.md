# Income-Prediction-Adult-Dataset

## Description
This repository serves as a comprehensive toolkit for income prediction using the Adult Dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It houses a collection of machine learning and statistical modeling techniques implemented in Python, aimed at forecasting income or salary based on various demographic and employment-related features.

## Key Features
1. **Bayesian Classifier Implementation**: Includes a Bayesian classifier for income prediction, utilizing probabilistic principles to make classification decisions.
2. **Feature Selection Techniques**: Implements feature selection methods such as Pearson and Kendall correlation coefficients to identify the most relevant features for income prediction.
3. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Provides a dimensionality reduction technique through PCA, enabling the reduction of feature space while preserving important information for modeling.
4. **Factor Analysis**: Offers factor analysis as another dimensionality reduction technique, exploring underlying factors influencing income variability in the dataset.
5. **Decision Tree Algorithm**: Incorporates a decision tree algorithm for income prediction, providing interpretable and easy-to-understand rules for classification.
6. **Predictive Model (Regression)**: Implements various regression models for income prediction, enabling users to explore different regression techniques and their performance.
7. **Neural Network Model**: Includes a neural network model for forecasting income, leveraging deep learning capabilities for complex pattern recognition in the dataset.

## Usage
Users can explore each module independently for detailed implementation and experimentation. The repository provides clear documentation and usage examples for seamless integration into other projects or research endeavors. Additionally, users can contribute enhancements, additional techniques, or optimizations to further enrich the toolkit's functionality.

This repository aims to facilitate research, experimentation, and practical applications in the domain of income prediction, providing a valuable resource for both novice and experienced practitioners in the field of machine learning and data science.
